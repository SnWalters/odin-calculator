# odin-calculator

In this project, I will be making a very simple calculator.
It will not adhere to the PEMDAS order of things, it's very simply, whatever
is input, will be calculated right away. It will also not include any
parentheses, but will be capable of decimal calculations.

I will try to include objects in here, since that was the last bit of
learning done, but I likely won't need them.

In the end, I did not need any objects, but I did utilize an array to hold
the numbers entered, and then joined them to display them to the 'screen'.

I also added a radial-gradient effect to the buttons hover.

Will need to revisit to add decimal functionality.
