# odin-calculator

In this project, I will be making a very simple calculator.
It will not adhere to the PEMDAS order of things, it's very simply, whatever
is input, will be calculated right away. It will also not include any
parentheses, but will be capable of decimal calculations.

I will try to include objects in here, since that was the last bit of
learning done, but I likely won't need them.
